We use an adding‑doubling radiation transfer model and a dust aerosol database to analyze the sensitivity of the radiance to the optical and micro‑physical properties of non‑spherical dust aerosols.

Aspect ratio is defined as a/b, where a is the long axis and b is the short axis of the prolate dust particle. The complex refractive index is set to be 1.50+0.001i.</p>

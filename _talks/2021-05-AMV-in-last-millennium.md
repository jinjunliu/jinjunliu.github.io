We study how volcanic eruptions and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability affect North Atlantic tropical cyclones. We compare storms during and after eruptions with those from positive/negative AMV phases to understand the AMV's impact.

Summary and conclusions
=======================
* AMV years exhibits some coherence regarding warm phases and cold phases in different CESM-LME simulation ensembles. Most volcano events occurred when AMV is in negative phase.
* During and year after the 10 volcano eruptions, the annual cycle of tropical storms decreases in Aug. and Sep. in CESM-LME full forcing ensemble. Genesis density also decreases in most region.
* Compared to the genesis density difference pattern between AMV cold & warm phases, the anomalies during and year after volcano eruptions look like a magnification of it.
* These results imply that the tropical cyclones’ response to AMV is likely mainly caused by volcano eruptions. In last millennium, volcano eruptions drive the AMV into cold phases.

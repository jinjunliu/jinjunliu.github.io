We study the relationship between the reversal of the meridional potential vorticity (PV) gradient, the instability of the African easterly jet (AEJ), and the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) index in CESM Last Millennium Ensemble to understand the physical relations of African OLR and Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) genesis.

<p style="text-align: center;">Fig. 2 shows that downscaled storm genesis density are positively correlated with African OLR indices. Correlation coefficients don’t differ much in the full forcing ensemble, volcanism only forcing, and GHG only forcing ensemble, indicating the relationship is persistent when different external forcings are applied.</p>

Summary and conclusions
=======================
* Downscaled storm genesis density in the CESM-LME simulation is enhanced in the years with large African OLR indices, in the area of Mexico Gulf, Caribbean sea, and the US east coast.
* Downscaled storm genesis in the CESM-LME simulation is significantly correlated with African OLR indices in all the three ensembles, suggesting this relationship is not climate dependent.
* When the strongest eastern zonal wind moves north, the quasi-geostrophic PV meridional gradient reversal also moves north, leads to larger African OLR indices.
* The downscaled storms are generated using the local environmental variables by randomly distributed seeds, while they are still affected by the jets in the western Africa.

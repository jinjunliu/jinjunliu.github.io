<!-- I study the thermodynamic properties and stability of the tropical atmosphere and how its evolution affects the suitability of the environment that spawns tropical storms. -->

<!-- My research encompasses the development and application of high-resolution climate models to study the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones. I have focused on several key areas, including the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones in various paleo-climates, and the analysis of large-scale environmental conditions that influence tropical cyclone formation. My work employs a combination of deep learning techniques, numerical simulations, and data analysis to enhance our understanding of atmospheric processes and improve the accuracy of climate models. -->

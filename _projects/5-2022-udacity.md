## Project 1: Hotel Reservation Application

The Hotel Reservation App is a Java-based application that enables users to book rooms, view their reservations,
and manage customers, rooms, and reservations as an admin. The app ensures rooms are not double-booked, provides recommended rooms, and handles exceptions gracefully.

## Project 2: Web Scrawler

I use concurrent programming to improve a legacy web crawler, making it multi-core compatible. The crawler reads a JSON file, downloads and parses multiple HTML documents in parallel, and records popular web terms in an output file. Additionally, a method profiling tool is built to measure the efficiency of the crawler and demonstrate the benefits of the parallel implementation.

## Project 3: UdaSecurity

developed a GUI application (UdaSecurity) to manage home security systems. To improve its scalability, I restructured it into a multi-module Maven project and incorporated unit tests using JUnit 5 and Mockito libraries. The program has been thoroughly tested and functions as intended.

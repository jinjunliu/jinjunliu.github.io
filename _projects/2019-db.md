We created a website for customers and car shop employees (including inventory clerks, salespeople, managers, and owners) to perform different activities through the website according to their roles. For example, the general public can search cars. Logged in users can search, and/or update the information of the car and customer database, per their permissions. Privileged users can also see statistics reports on the website. We implemented the database with MySQL and designed the front-end with PHP, JavaScript, and CSS.

The website is hosted on [InfinitiFree](https://infinityfree.com/). Thanks to them for providing free hosting service! Website link: [http://usedcar.kesug.com/](http://usedcar.kesug.com/).

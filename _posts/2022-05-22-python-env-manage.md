## What is a Python Environment

Python is a cross-platform object-oriented scripting language that can run on platforms such as Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. A Python environment is a folder that contains the Python interpreter and all necessary libraries.

## Why Manage Python Environments?

Different projects may require different Python versions and libraries, and Python libraries may also depend on each other, with specific version requirements. If all projects use the same Python environment, the environment will become messy and difficult to maintain when there are many projects. For example, project A requires `Python 3.6` and `Pandas 1.0.1`, and project B requires `Python 3.10` and `Pandas 1.3.5`. Although Python interpreters and many Python libraries are backward compatible with themselves, lower versions of Python may not support higher versions of third-party libraries. Therefore, we need to separate the Python environments of these projects so that each project can run independently. The following image (from dataquest.io) shows a simple example of a virtual Python environment: three Python environments are independent of each other and do not affect each other. When one of the Python environments is operated on (such as installing or deleting a library, upgrading a library version), the other two Python environments will not be affected.

## Python Environment Management Tools

Python environment management tools include:

1. [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/): An open-source tool developed by `Anaconda` company. This tool is included in its products `Anaconda` and `Miniconda` (both are Python distributions).

2. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html): A library included in Python 3.3 and above, used to create virtual Python environments.

Either of these two tools can be chosen, but I prefer to use `conda` for version and package management.

### conda

To use conda, you first need to install `Anaconda` or `Miniconda`. The difference between the two is that `Anaconda` is a complete environment that includes the Python interpreter and all commonly used third-party libraries (such as commonly used `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.), while `Miniconda` only includes the Python interpreter and does not include any third-party libraries. This can save disk space, and it also comes with conda, which allows you to install environments and packages according to your needs. For novice users, it is recommended to install `Anaconda`.

Anaconda download link: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Miniconda download link: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Simply select the installation package corresponding to the operating system. It is recommended to install the 64-bit version. After installation, when you open a command prompt window, a default environment called `base` will be automatically launched. This environment is the default environment of `Anaconda` or `Miniconda`. If you don't want `base` to be automatically launched every time, you can run the following command in the command prompt window:

```bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

View all conda environments:

```bash
conda env list
```

After running the above command, all conda environments will be displayed. If you haven't created an environment yet, only the `base` environment will be displayed.

Create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n my_env
```

`my_env` is the name of the environment, which can be arbitrarily specified. If you want to create a new environment and specify the Python version, you can do it like this:

```bash
conda create -n my_env python=3.10
```

The above command will create an environment named `my_env` and install Python 3.10 in the environment. Activate the environment just created:

```bash
conda activate my_env
```

If this environment will no longer be used, you can completely delete the environment with the following command:

```bash
conda remove --name my_env --all
```

The above commands can be used for basic environment management. For more environment management commands, please refer to conda's [official environment management documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

In addition to environment management, `conda` can also perform package management. Package management refers to the installation, upgrade, deletion, etc. of packages. To install a package with conda, you can run:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge numpy
```

The above command will install the `numpy` package in the current environment. `-c conda-forge` indicates downloading from conda's official repository, and `conda-forge` is the name of conda's official repository.

**Note:** Before installing packages with conda, switch to the environment first. For example, if you want to install the `numpy` package in the `my_env` environment, you need to run

```bash
conda activate my_env
```

to activate the `my_env` environment, and then run the above command to install the `numpy` package in the `my_env` environment.

`conda`'s abilities of managing environment is not limited to Python. You can also create environments for other languages, such as NCAR Command Language (NCL), R, etc. For example, to create an environment for NCL, you can run:

```bash
conda create -n ncl_stable -c conda-forge ncl
```

This will create an environment named `ncl_stable` and install the `ncl` package in the environment. To activate the environment, run:

```bash
conda activate ncl_stable
```

This is all you need to do to install NCL with conda (so convenient!). Using conda to install NCL is also the recommended way by the NCL official website. For more information, please refer to the [NCL installation documentation](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/conda.shtml).

For more package management commands, please refer to conda's [official package management documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html).

### venv

`venv` is a library that comes with Python, so if you have already installed the Python interpreter, you can use `venv` directly. `venv` stands for virtual environment, and it can create and manage virtual environments, which do not affect each other.

To create a virtual environment:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir my_project
python3 -m venv my_project/my_env
```

The first step `cd ~` switches to the home directory (`~` represents the home directory), but you can also switch to another directory depending on where you want to store your project. The second step `mkdir my_project` creates a folder. The third step `python3 -m venv my_project/my_env` creates a virtual environment, and the root directory of the virtual environment is `my_project/my_env`. Note: `my_project` and `my_env` are the names given to the project directory and virtual environment directory, and you can change these two directory names.

After creating the virtual environment, activate it:

```bash
source my_project/my_env/bin/activate
```

If you run

```bash
which python
```

You will see the path of the Python interpreter in your virtual environment. In this example, the path is `~/my_project/my_env/bin/python`.

To exit the virtual environment, run:

```bash
deactivate
```

To completely delete the virtual environment, run after deactivating:

```bash
rm -rf my_project/my_env
```

Delete all files in the virtual environment.

To manage packages in the `venv` virtual environment, you can only use the `pip` command. First, upgrade `pip` to the latest version:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then run the following command, for example, to install the `numpy` package:

```bash
python3 -m pip install numpy
```

**Note**: You need to activate the virtual environment first to install the `numpy` package in the virtual environment. For more information on using `pip`, please refer to the [pip user guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/).

If you want to learn more about using virtual environments, you can refer to the [venv section of the Python official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and the second reference in this article.

## Summary

This article introduces two commonly used Python environment management tools, `conda` and `venv`, and you can use either one. Personally, I prefer to use `conda` because it is simple and convenient, and `conda` can also manage packages. The advantage of `venv` is that it is included with Python and does not require the installation of `Anaconda` or `Miniconda`.

Python environment management is a necessary skill for Python developers. Isolating different Python environments allows different projects to not interfere with each other and can be better maintained.
